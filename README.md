Discrete Multivariate Modeling Simulator

The primary goals of this software is to teach and demo discrete multivariate modeling as applied to data mining and predictive modeling (often referred to as Reconstructability Analysis).  Issues of computational efficiency and scalability will be addressed after the project in its current form reaches maturity.

All current work is implemented and tested within src/representations.py.
